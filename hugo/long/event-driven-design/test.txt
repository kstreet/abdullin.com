# I want to write a book, again.

Since HappyPancake project completed, I found myself with a bit of
spare time.




Week 1.

1. asciidoc is a good format, more expressive than markdown
2. emacs has many things out-of-box: doc-mode, flyspell, goodwriting
3. reused concept of fast feedback from the happy pancake - live rebuild
4. golang is a good protyping language, used it for scaffolding
5. pushed to private bitbucket to give access to reviewers
6. using asciidoc comments to store metadata rendered to org-mode format
7. considering to switch to Haskell
8. Introduced TODOs, spread across the document, summarized to asciidoc outline
9. Introduced IDEAs - one-line summaries for the block of text. That's my building block
10. Using evernote to clip references
