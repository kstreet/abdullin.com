title: DDD Summit 2012 Summary -
---
<p>Some time ago I was honored (probably because of some sheer mistake) to be invited to <strong>DDD Summit 2012</strong> organized by Eric Evans. The event took place in Portland over the course of last week and it was an absolute blast for me. </p>

</ul>

<p>In essence, we were discussing various aspects of DDD in small focus groups and all together, going out on hikes and dinners, talking, talking and talking. There was a wide variety of topics covered during these three days.</p>

<p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/uploads/2012/05/2012-05-20-DDD-topics.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1337508869497" alt=""/></span></span></p>

<p>For me, this was an amazing opportunity to dive deeper into DDD nuances, practical experience and ideas shared by the leading thought leaders.</p>

<h2>Outcomes and Commitments</h2>

<p>Long story made short, there are some outcomes of this event that should benefit of the community (including some of my personal commitments).</p>

<p>There is going to be <strong>more activity</strong> on the <a href="http://dddcommunity.org/">DDDCommunity.org site</a>, that might have felt a little neglected over the course of last year (with a lot of good materials being hidden by accident). Things will start improving within the next few weeks (more regular updates and more structured community).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I personally hope to contribute some small practical experience bits of community building from projects and groups on DDD/CQRS (i.e. <a href="http://cqrsguide.com/">CQRSGuide</a> and CQRS Beers with awesome communities around EU) , <a href="http://lokad.github.com/">Lokad projects</a> and <a href="http://distributedpodcast.com/">Distributed Podcast</a>, maybe even bringing all these closer together.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Practical samples</strong> are a big thing for demonstrating DDD. We plan to bring them together on a github and refresh a little bit (may be even adding Scala/Akka implementation!). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My own <a href="http://lokad.github.com/lokad-cqrs/">Lokad.CQRS Sample Project</a> is essentially a sample of DDD (with all the latest tech stack, cloud portability, practical things and even some DDD modeling toolset) that currently lacks the most important thing - proper domain model. I plan to fix this last problem by the mid of June, in addition to committing to things I've been delaying far too long (i.e.: articles and videos about the sample project).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>More articles and materials</strong> about the Domain-Driven Design are expected be published; some of the topics were already outlined by the summit participants. There are plans to establish better environment for reviewing and shepherding such materials, which should definitely help.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I personally plan to <a href="http://abdullin.com/posts/">continue writing</a> about various aspects of DDD/CQRS+ES. Hopefully these new articles will start making slightly more sense due to focus not only on disposable technical details (which CQRS+ES is, despite all its coolness and cloud-portability), but also on strategic and design decisions governed by DDD. Besides, some more peer pressure is expected on them :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are even more cool long-term plans about pushing DDD and state of the art in the community, however they are long-term. Meanwhile, you can stay tuned for the updates via <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23DDDesign">#DDDesign</a> (I'll make sure that any official DDDCommunity news will be auto-published on twitter via this tag as well).</p>

<p><em>How does this look?</em></p>
