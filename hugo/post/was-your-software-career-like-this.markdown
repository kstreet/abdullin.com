title: Was Your Software Career Like This?
---
<p>A week ago I've published <a href="http://abdullin.com/journal/2010/10/22/top-10-reasons-to-do-cqrs-in-a-pdf.html">CQRS "Research tree"</a> post. It had a PDF that was mapping together benefits of the methodologies that compose together <em>CQRS-based development</em> and <em>Cloud computing</em> (in my personal perspective) along with the directions that you can drive your software project through, once you get inside this territory.</p>

<p>After getting feedback from various sources (thank you, folks!), I've decided to add a few more steps to this road-map. These are the things one might encounter before stalking into the CQRS territory.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NB: Just a side note. I understand that CQRS is a buzz-word. Yet as a buzz-word it conveniently packs multiple <strong>time-proven concepts</strong> under a <strong>single mental model</strong>, that is easy to work with (and share the knowledge further). As such, it works for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Below you will find image of how the draft looks like right now. It all starts with <em>Personal Motivation</em>, <em>Unit Testing</em> and <em>Source Control</em>.</p>

<p>The Roadmap is based on my personal experience coupled with the insights I've been getting from the development communities. This overview might be different from yours, since I didn't have any formal CS education (administrative economics instead).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NB: Later on I'm planning to add detailed descriptions with the "enables" section, just like the first roadmap had. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does it resemble your software development career? Are there any important steps that I've missed?</p>
