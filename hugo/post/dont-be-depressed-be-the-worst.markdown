<p>I just got this comment to my old post on <a href="http://abdullin.com/journal/2010/11/19/10-steps-to-become-better-net-developer.html">10 Steps to Become Better .NET Developer</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I just graduated, and i am willing to become a VB. Net developer, but after saw your posting, i found myself is nothing, depressed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, first of all: I'm sorry that my post made you feel this way. I'm just a guy that still learns software development (and feels really stupid for a number of reasons on a regular basis) and so please don't take my words for granted. </p>

<p>Second, <strong>technologies are pretty much irrelevant and replaceable</strong> (they never teach relevant technologies at universities, anyway). </p>

<p>Third, at the university you have gained the most important skill for you future career - <strong>ability to learn, reason and move forward</strong>. This will allow you to become whomever you want to, even when you find your life goals expanding in the upcoming years.</p>

<p>Fourth, please read this article <a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596518387/accurate_self_assessment.html">Be the Worst</a>, which was shared with me by <a href="https://twitter.com/kcstreet">Kerry Street</a> last night. Feeling like you are the worst is a good position to move forward on your learning path (and definitely much better than feeling like you are the best). </p>

<p>Fifth, good luck. If you have any questions, please, <strong>don't hesitate to ask and reach out</strong>. I'll try to help. Besides, .NET has a marvellous development community that is always willing to help, if you are willing to move forward with this trade.</p>

<p>PS:  BTW, I graduated from an economic department of a university in the middle of Russia. They taught us how to plan a cattle herd, theoretically command a military unit and manage a Soviet Republic. My first .NET classes were self-taught by reading a text-book while spending summer working on constructions sites of Baltimore in USA. I think, that was pretty low for a start of .NET career (not that I got that far from there since then). You can do much better.</p>
