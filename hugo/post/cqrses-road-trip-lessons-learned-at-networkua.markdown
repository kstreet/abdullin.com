<p><a href="http://network-ua.com/">NetworkUA</a> conference at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv">Kharkiv</a> was amazing! It felt a bit unofficial and practical all way through. Attendees, organizers and final feedback were just great.</p>

<p>I couldn't even wish for a better start for our <a href="http://abdullin.com/roadtrip-2011">CQRS/ES road-trip</a>.</p>

<p>There was a <strong>outstanding panel of speakers</strong> - Sander Hoogendoorn (no frameworks), Ayende Rahien (no-SQL), Greg Young (DDD/CQRS). Note, how all these talks are focusing on keeping things simple and practical.</p>

<p>I was presenting on event-centric development (we had the same setup with Greg as in Vienna, where he was doing crash course which I follow up with small bits of practical experience and applying all that in various projects).</p>

<p>Obviously, my talk was far worse than presentations of Greg or Sander (well, that's just 2nd time I'm doing this presentation, as opposed to 50th of Greg :), but certain things come only with the experience. Next time it will be better.</p>

<p>Sheer lack of time felt a lot: rushing through slides to fit into 45min talk. I was probably talking too fast. But we did catch up with some Questions and Answers in the corridor afterwards (blocking the entire corridor with a small crowd for quite a bit :)</p>

<p>Lessons learned:</p>

<ul>
<li>Prepare core structure of the presentation and work it out (i.e.: enough for 20 minutes of a talk).</li>
<li>Identify pieces of presentation that could be gradually added or excluded, depending on the lack or abundance of time.</li>
<li>Make sure that you are heard well (not all conferences will have head-set mics).</li>
<li>I need to finish the FarleyFile sample on CQRS/ES (or, at least, finally publish it as it is).</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, in addition to the actual presentation-related skills, there were quite a few things learned  during the after-party and unofficial hang-outs. But that's more technical (I'll blog about some things later, as promised).</p>

<p>Speakers arrangement was amazing - small group, passionate about development and all agreeing on learning and keeping things simple. This made the final panel quite interesting as well - sharing motivation, inspiration and vision of future.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This actually makes an interesting rule for the future, when deciding whether to participate in a conference or not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Feedback after the conference was incredible.</strong> People were sharing <a href="http://216.154.213.206/twitter.html">emotions and thanks</a> to the organizers. Well, I'm still receiving emails and DMs. The most important thing: developers are interested in exploring, trying and learning. So they probably got something out of the conference.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I were to help in organizing European CQRS conference some time later (as discussed in the community) - I know much better now how it should look like to be educational, inspirational and also beneficial for the community's progress. Fun included.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.akvelon.com.ua/">Akvelon</a> and <a href="http://sigmaukraine.com/">Sigma Ukraine</a> for providing an amazing atmosphere. To speakers - for providing the company, sharing ideas and experience (the morning is a bit rough after the last after-party :). To Microsoft - for providing a great framework and tooling for exploring all these ideas.</p>

<p>In short - I've learned a lot already, making this <a href="http://abdullin.com/roadtrip-2011">CQRS/ES road-trip</a> really educational already. And this is just the beginning.</p>

<p>We'll have an Event-centric IT Cafe in Kharkov today. Then on Monday - we'll start to move slowly in the direction of Kiev towards Event-Centric weekend (depending on how things work with the developers out at the cafe).</p>
