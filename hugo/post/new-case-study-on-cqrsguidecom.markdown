title: New Case Study on CQRSGuide.com
---
<p>I've published final version of a new case study about one of latest Lokad's projects. This project had to go live on February 29th. This was caused by an unfortunate sequence of events with our cloud provider and immediate need to fail over to a different provider in order to keep some of the services running.</p>

<p>Case study provides rough overview of the most important CQRS/DDD concepts that made their way into this project. Some of them are already presented in Lokad.CQRS Sample Project. Some other are yet to be ported into the open source.</p>

<p>These are kinds of things that enable us to solve everyday problems, help customers and try to push the state of the art. </p>

<p>BTW, if you happen to be a fan of Lokad forecasting technologies - stay tuned. There is a really big thing being prepared by our awesome analytics team. Announcement will come soon.</p>
