ReactJS is a JavaScript library from Facebook. It allows developers to
design User Interfaces by composing together reusable components.

// TODO: add high-level overview of ReactJS

ReactJS components can split in two categories: _stateful_ and _pure_.

## Pure ReactJS Components

You can think of pure ReactJS components as simple functions which
take immutable data as arguments and return HTML declaration.

This is how such a component might look like:

> Note, that this code is `JSX`, which is a syntactic extension
> of JavaScript. For example, `<ul>...</ul>` translates to
> `React.createElement(ul, ...)`;

!! include example reactjs__simple-component

This component


## Stateful ReactJS Components




Simple (pure) ReactJS components can thought of as functions which
take some immutable data (props) as arguments


design User Interfaces by composing them from simple and reusable
components. These compo

declare small and focused components for User Interfaces. These
components can then be nested and composed together







Library from Facebook with a single magical feature.
