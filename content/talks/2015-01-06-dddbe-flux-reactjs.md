---

In January 2015 I was invited by awesome DDDBE community in Belgium to
give a talk about building responsive web applications with Facebook
Flux and React.js.

This was a big honor, since European DDD community is the place
where the most of recent insights in Domain-Driven Design originate
from.

Below you will find links to video, slides and the source code for
this presentation.

## Trappist Beer

Belgiam DDD community kindly introduced me to the
[Trappist Beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trappist_beer), which is
probably among the best beers in the world.

> Trappist beer is brewed by Trappist breweries. Only ten monasteries — six
> in Belgium, two in the Netherlands, one in Austria and one in the
> United States — currently brew beer and sell it as Authentic
> Trappist Product.

Weeks later, these few treasured bottles reminded me about the given
promise to commit something cool to the Open Source, marking it with
`#dddbe_beers` tag.

Thanks to _Orval Trappist Ale`, `seq` was delivered. It is a library
in Golang to verify assertions against complex objects (e.g. events
and API responses). We always wanted to have this library, while
working on event-driven specifications at
[HappyPancake](http://abdullin.com/happypancake/) project.

You can find it out on [github](https://github.com/abdullin/seq).
