My starting days in HappyPancake were quite intense and interesting,
despite the fact that I could spend only 20 hours per week on the
project. I learned a lot of things that would be be completely out of
reach for a .NET developer within Microsoft OS. Here are some
bullet-points:

* Google Hangouts work nicely for team collaboration and screen
    sharing.
* SyncSpace drawing app is probably the best collaborative white-board
    for a distributed team.
* [Mindmups](http://www.mindmup.com/) are great for collaborative and
    personal brain-storming.
* Erlang is a great language for building low-latency and
    CPU-efficient apps. It has some learning overhead for a .NET guy
    like me.
* Golang is a great language with good ecosystem and really good
    performance. If compared to erlang, golang has a lower learning
    overhead for a .NET guy.

Within these days we invested time in establishing high-level design
guidelines for the system to be implemented. High-level goals were:

* Iterative development with emergent design (we don't know all
    the answers)
* Micro-services with support for experimentation and A/B testing (to
    get these answers and discard wrong assumptions)
* Base design evolution on reality and measuring it to validate
    assumptions
* Ubiquitous language for communication between services : HTTP with
    JSON/HTML
* Any language within the service (as long as it runs on Linux)
* Designing for a distributed team that wants to spend years learning
    things, experimenting and playing with cool tech.

Making this work requires a lot of responsibility and ownership, which
have to be factored into the design, as well. We currently believe
that [Micro-Services](http://vimeo.com/79866979) approach with a bit
of [Programmer Anarchy](http://vimeo.com/53213400) might work well for
our case, as a foundation for building things up.

For the upcoming week I plan to continue catching up with Golang
(currently reading through The Way To Go) and then start drafting a
prototype of low-latency Message Bus with Event Store capabilities and
FoundationDb backend (codename `BroStore`).
