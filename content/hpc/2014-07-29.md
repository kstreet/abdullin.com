Last week was quite productive and exciting.

**Introduction of use cases** into our development cycle **worked out
really well**, helping to deliver tangible features in the absence of
tangible UI to target (node.js front-end development is paused till
Tomas gets back from the vacation).

These use cases so far:

- serve as high-level behavior tests aligned with the domain
  language (compact and non-fragile);
- drive development towards a better event-driven design;
- produce nice human-readable documentation, as a side-effect;
- provide really **fast feedback** cycle.

Actually, **these use cases are the design**. We can probably take
them and rewrite the entire system in a completely different language
in 2 weeks. And we can do that without loosing any features or
scalability options.

However, these nice benefits are not as important as the fact the we
**spent last week developing new features and improving code coverage,
while really enjoying the process**.

_Pieter_ jumped right into the game, picking up on use case
development and extending the framework to support edge-cases which I
missed (e.g.: testing file uploads or using real HTTP server to allow
inspecting raw HTTP requests with WireShark). He already covered
`drafts` module with use cases.

_Pieter_ also invested time last week cleaning things across the
code-base.


I spent the last week both adding use cases (coverage of `chat`,
`alerts`, `news`, `poll`), fixing bugs revealed by them and
adding proper handling of `member-blocked` and `member-unblocked`
across the system.

As of now, we have 33 use cases covering 15 API calls. We know this
number exactly, because of a tiny little helper command `summary`
which can print out information about all use cases.

With that command (and the power of BASH), one can easily answer
questions like:

- How many use cases are in the system?
- Which URIs are not covered by the tests?
- Which events are published or consumed by module X?
- What are the dependencies between the modules?
- Which events are not covered by any use case?

This self-building knowledge about the system is another reason which
makes writing use cases so rewarding.

I also took a bite and tweaked our build server to include commit
summaries in chat messages posted to Slack. This way, it is easier to
observe team progress without going to git repository. This also
encourages frequent pushes, since `drone` picks up only the latest
commit in a push.

This week I'm going to continue delivering features, covering them
with more use cases and also working on the ETL code to extract data
from HPCv1 into our new system.
