Last week was dedicated to front-end development. We made some nice
progress there, thanks to LazoJS framework and _Jason Strimpel_
himself. This framework, supported by the entire Node.JS ecosystem,
makes development quite simple even for somebody so unexperienced in
UI like me.

Of course, Node.js has some drawbacks. For example, its **performance
is worse than the performance of golang code**, pushed to the
extreme. There also are **a lot of bad things in JavaScript
development itself**: callback hell, memory leaks, relatively poor
debugging experience, low quality of some public packages.

However, if you consciously **stick with the good parts and avoid the
bad ones**, the experience can be quite rewarding.

First of all, since our front-end code is rather simple and stateless,
**we could always solve some performance problems by getting another
machine**. This would be much cheaper, than the time of a developer.

> Virtual Machines are available starting from a few dollars per
> month. That is probably cheaper than a few hours of development.

Second, **Node.js has diverse ecosystem of things that help you**
develop web applications. If you pick a few good ones and stick with
them, your life becomes simpler, speeding up the development. Here are
some that were adopted last week:

- [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) - pluggable linting utility that
**checks for common styling and syntax issues** on JavaScript code. We
adopted the style of
[Felix Geisend√∂rfer](https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide) for
our project. ESLint is a **part of our build no**w. If there is an
extra comma at the end of array or some trailing space - it will fail
the entire build.
- [JSFmt](http://rdio.github.io/jsfmt/) - utility for **formatting,
searching, and rewriting JavaScript**. Whenever a file is saved to
disk, we automatically reformat it.
- [Reflex](https://github.com/cespare/reflex) - **runs a command or
restarts a server whenever sources are changed**. This reduces
development friction a lot. Kudos go to _Pieter_ for finding this one.
- [Flycheck](http://flycheck.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) - syntax
checking extension for Emacs that runs ESLint in the background.
- [node-inspector](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector) -
**Node.js debugger** based on Blink Developer Tools. We use it via the
`node-debug` wrapper.
- [web-mode](http://web-mode.org/) - HTML template editing mode for
Emacs that understands embedded CSS, Handlebars and Javascript.
- [Lazo.js](https://github.com/walmartlabs/lazojs) - **client-server
web framework** for building responsive applications. It deserves a
separate podcast. BackboneJS, UnderscoreJS and jQuery come in bundled.

Besides, there is [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) (headless WebKit
scriptable with JS) which could be used to verify UI use-cases. If we
make these use-cases runnable against
[BrowserStack](http://www.browserstack.com/), then we have all
operating systems and browsers covered for us.

Feature-wise, we implemented infinite scrolling for our feeds, started
working on real-time notifications (highlighting menu items which
contain new content). _Pieter_ was also implementing the profile UI.

_Tomas_ will join HPC2 development effort later this week. Last week
he deployed a new `like` feature to HPC1, to start capturing
information about the most popular content (we could use it to
populate feeds in HPC2). It was used almost a hundred thousand times
within the first 24 hours!
