After a couple of iterations we settled for the go language as the
primary language for rewrite of happy pancake from C#. Ideally
we'll converge on Haskell later (that's something I would
really like, due to the powerful type system and high suitability for
capturing domain models). However, for the time being the primary
language will be go. Reasons for that being:

* Simplicity of the language and similarity to C#
* Excellent ecosystem for the development of backend servers
* Availability of go drivers for FoundationDB
* Linux development stack (Ubuntu + Sublime/Vim) without large license
    fees
* Language is expressive enough for our needs
* Excellent resources and help tools

Why [FoundationDB](https://foundationdb.com/) is so important to us
- would be another blog post later (long-story short: it is like
fast Redis with proper clustering support and only one data structure
- sorted key-value ranges).

There are a few downsides of golang that we are going to live with:

* Concept of workspaces is somewhat messed up (imagine, that you have
    to work with two versions of a library). However, this is not
    nearly as bad as dll and nuget hell in .NET world
* Absence of generics or type inference that would work as such

Getting started with golang was rather simple. We went with Tomas
through:

* [An introduction to programming in Go](http://www.golang-book.com/assets/pdf/gobook.pdf)
* [Effective go](http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
* [A tour of go](http://tour.golang.org/)

All of these resources are an easy read (mostly attributed to the
simplicity of the language itself). While doing that I setup an Ubuntu
(LTS) with [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) and
[GoSublime](https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime) package. Given
all that, it was relatively easy to start porting layer code for
FoundationDB from python to golang.

While working on layer code, I had also to encounter Python along with
its REPL. Syntax was a bit odd in the beginning, but quite simple in
the long run. No tutorials even needed.

For the next week I plan to finish porting queue and pub/sub layers
for FoundationDB from python to golang. We'll see how it goes from
there.
