For the last week I spent most of the time pairing with Pieter,
learning more about our the performance and behaviour of our
anticipated stack (for the second version of HappyPancake.com). It was
thoroughly interesting exercise in systems engineering.

Here is what our anticipated design looks like right now:

With this design we want to have 25ms latency of HTTP reads
(non-cached, 99% percentile) given the throughput of 50000 requests
per second. A/B testing, feature toggling, continuous delivery and
live upgrades (with ghost mode and ramp-up) included.

Here is a short summary of lessons learned within the last week:

* **Tomas is an absolute beast** when it comes to crunching out small
    open source libraries
* It is quite **easy to publish statistics from an app and then gather
    them in a nice WebUI** for crunching (using client library fsd to
    publish to local [statsD app](https://github.com/etsy/statsd/) via
    UDP. StatsD currently pushes stats to
    [Librato Metrics](https://metrics.librato.com/metrics) with delay
    of 10 seconds).
* HTTP servers in Go are quite good, but can be a pain to extend or
    augment
*   [Nanomsg](http://nanomsg.org/) is really nice and performant, however the documentation is lacking.
*    [Profiling capabilities of Golang](http://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs) are absolutely stunning.
* Spending a week developing and debugging golang apps, while
    benchmarking them on a Digital Ocean cluster - teaches you a
    thing or two about Linux environment. It is awesome.
* Software engineering is about making theories about how your code
    will behave in production, then running experiments to validate
    these theories. You iterate and learn.
* Pairing up with somebody is an amazing opportunity to transfer
    knowledge and produce better quality code (I lost track of the
    number of times I was stunned and humbled by the experience and
    insight of other team members - so much to learn). We
    currently use TeamViewer (best image and keyboard sharing
    experience) and Skype for the voice. Campfire is for group chats
    (and chat ops).

For the upcoming week I'll be working on pushing our stack
closer to the desired performance numbers (we don't meat the
goal, yet). It is an interesting exercise which forces you to learn a
lot and go deep (to the point of tuning the OS).
