I started merging bits of my reactive prototype into the
document-driven prototype of HappyPancake that Pieter was working
on. While at that, we spent a lot of time discussing the design and
iterating over it.

It was really cool to see how the structure of the solution **shifted
focus from technical model to functional model**. Previously our
golang packages (which roughly map to lightweight .NET projects)
contained files grouped by their technical intent (e.g.: controllers,
models, documents). This added friction to development:

* a lot of context switching was required in order to work on a single
  use case, touching multiple packages;
* solution structure enforced certain architecture style upon the
  codebase (when you have folders like models, controllers, views and
  documents, naturally you will be trying to fit your implementation
  into these);
* merge conflicts were unavoidable, since too much code was shared.

Over the course of the week, we switched to a different design,
aligning packages with use cases. You might consider this to be a
tactical domain-driven design (we didn’t touch any of the strategic
parts like Bounded Contexts or Ubiquitous language, since our core
domain is extremely simple).

Golang packages get tightly aligned with our use cases. They either
implement cases directly (e.g.: by exposing http handlers to render
the UI and process POST requests from the browser) or they help other
packages to fulfill their role by providing supporting functionality
or structures (e.g. authentication utils, http helper methods, core
value objects).

Of course, the road wasn’t all about roses and pretty ladies -
**you can’t just split codebase between a bunch of folders and hope
that all will work and make sense**. It is never that easy.

We had a lot of discussions like :

* How do we decompose functionality into multiple packages which will
    work together to implement these use cases?
* This code does not make any sense, what are we doing wrong?
* How do we name this thingy?
* What is the simplest approach to implement these use cases?
* How can we work together on this functionality?

I really enjoyed every minute of these discussions with
Pieter, they were focused on the problem domain instead of fiddling
around artificial architectural constraints imposed by the overall
design. Besides, so far, we were able to resolve these questions and
thread the thin line between over-engineered monolith and messy big
ball of mud.

We are not sure if we’ll be able to walk this path later, yet so far
**each step led to a deeper insight in the domain of HappyPancake**
(just like domain-driven design promises).
There are a few really cool things about our current design:

* it is extremely easy to collaborate on the code : there are almost
    no merge conflicts;
* we are free to experiment with implementation styles within packages
    without turning solution into a mess;
* golang is designed to support small and focused packages, this shows
    up frequently as yet another tiny and deeply satisfying moment.

The most important part is : our code is a reflection of domain
knowledge captured in a tangible form. Codebase is structured around
that knowledge and not vice versa.

In the meanwhile _Tomas_ was busy with administrative work and
HPC1. Towards the end of the week he also got a chance to start
working on the HTML design of HPC2 in a stealth mode. Pieter and me
are both really anxious to see what comes out of this work.

Also on Friday we were interviewed by a couple of students on the
topic of CQRS. I’d think that our joint statement was something like
“CQRS is new name for denormalization with a little recollection of
what happened before 2010”.
