Over the last days we revisited the entire stack, cleaning up the code
and improving the design until we were happy with it.

We've polished these functionally distinct pieces:

* **Registration** flow.
* **Login/logout** and authentication details.
* **Discovery feed** - equivalent of a facebook newsfeed, with infinite scrolling.
* **Chat**, delivering messages and presence notifications reactively.
* Reactive **navbar**.
* **Profile view** with public and private photos, liking and ability to favorite.

That covers only functionality polished from front to the end. We also
have backend implemented for the rest of the system (drafts,
favorites, online lists, reviewing, alerts, history, flirts etc).

**Facebook Flux Architecture was a pleasure to work**. It is more simple
and elegant than any other web UI stack I've worked with
before. Composition and reuse of UI components is superb.

Flux methodology would be quite familiar to anyone who has dealt with
CQRS/ES concepts before. It is very easy to reason about and leads to
clean and intuitive codebases.

We used isomorphic Flux components from Yahoo to speed up our
development (the ones from the next version of Yahoo Mail), basing the
initial frontend layout on the chat sample from Yahoo.

[Bill Fisher](https://twitter.com/fisherwebdev) (Facebook) and
[Michael Ridgway](https://twitter.com/theridgway) (Yahoo) were very
kind and extremely helpful. They helped to speed up our development a
lot.

## Design Summary

To summarize. Our tech stack and software design went through many
iterations. We optimized for:

* simplicity of the code and design;
* performance and scalability;
* ability to evolve, grow and perform A/B testing;
* ability to develop and maintain with very few people.

Resulting design looks quite simple:

This combination of technologies and tools is optimized for a growing
social web site with 600000 members (50% of them - active) and planned
expansion to multiple countries. All that - with a limited development
effort and resources.
