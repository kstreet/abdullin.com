At the end of 2013 [Tomas Roos](https://twitter.com/ptomasroos)
invited me to join the team of HappyPancake, largest free dating site
in Sweden. It was initially written in ASP.NET with MS SQL Database
server, soon to become a rather complex solution that was expensive to
scale.

Together with [Pieter Joost](https://twitter.com/pjvds), our small
distributed team of 3 people started redesigning this site towards a
simpler design that would be easier to evolve in the future.

This is the story of that project.
