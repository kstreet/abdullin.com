It is good to be back from the vacation. Not only you feel rested, but
you also get to see all the cool things done by the team.

Tomas and Pieter focused on pushing forward seeding utility that takes
data dumps from the production systems and transforms it into the
events for the second version of HappyPancake. They moved beyond
Finland dataset (the smallest one) and started seeding Sweden, which
yields more than 500.000.000 events. This allowed to polish code
heavily (e.g. memory and connection leaks are detected early this
days) with real-world data.

I focused on cleanups and cross-cutting concerns this week. Removing
`member` module helped in making modules more decoupled (now almost
all data is denormalized by modules in their own storages).

Then, to push this even further, I physically separated modules from
each other, **giving each module a separate database** for production
and tests. This is a big win for us, since this allows to replace one
big and expensive SQL server (running it currently in production) with
a bunch of smaller servers, that cost less and are easier to scale.

This improvement required introduction of _module specification_ - a
data structure describing some static qualities of the module, which
are known even before it is registered in the infrastructure. Such
specification currently includes:

- module name (also acting as DB name, if it has one);
- module DB schema (SQL scripts to create and reset DB contents);
- use cases that describe behaviors of the module.

With such information, we can create databases while initializing
environment and pass connections to these databases to modules on
registration. This also allows to run use case verification in
separate temporary databases, which are destroyed at the end of test
run.

With improvements from _Pieter_ our auto-generated module diagrams
became even more helpful. They give additional perspective into the
code, allowing to see missing or odd pieces. For example, here is
diagram of the `chat` module:

As you can see, `POST /chat/poll` is marked as read, since it is
implemented but not covered with any single use case. This endpoint
serves data to legacy UI served directly by the back-end (to be
removed). It is to be removed, hence there was no point in testing
it. Red marker serves as concise reminder of that.

Same goes for `member-typing` and `member-read-thread` domain events,
which are subscribed to but are never really used (in a way that is
verified by use cases). This is also something that we will need to
cleanup, once focus shifts back to the UI.


Next week we plan to decide on the road map for implementing our
UI. Currently it is served as HTML directly by our back-end, which is
not a good thing (modules get complicated). Possible options include:

- move html generation with all the resources into a separate
  front-end module (or a collection of them);
- kill existing UI code and reimplement everything with node.js and
  rendr;
- find some other alternatives.

In the longer term we want to have rich single-page application that
offers smooth experience to our users (feeling almost like a native
application). However, implementing it right now might be a long and
risky shot. It seems to be safer to capture existing requirements in a
simple User Interface (building upon the code that we already have but
with better application design) and deliver that to production. We
could always improve later.

Besides user interface, there also is some more back end work to do, like:

- implementing `albums` module (public and private photo albums);
- implementing tags and categories for the profiles;
- improving performance of the system to let it process Sweden dataset
  faster;
- figure out profile properties.

I personally look forward to get back to work on the front end, since
it is a part of critical path (in terms of project management) to our
delivery. Earlier this week I started reading the book on
[Single Page Web Applications](http://www.amazon.com/Single-Page-Applications-end-end/dp/1617290750?tag=trackr-20)
only to discover that web app development these days strongly
resembles development of desktop applications. Aside from the
specifics of HTML, CSS, JS and various browsers, design principles and
patterns are quite similar. It should be fun.
