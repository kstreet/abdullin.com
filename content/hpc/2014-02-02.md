During the last week at HPC my focus has been on
[FoundationDB](https://foundationdb.com/). FDB is a nice NoSQL
database which has a bunch of great properties:

* It stores key-value pairs of bytes, where keys are always
    sorted. You have usual `GET/SET/DELETE` operations along with
    range operations that come from sorted key nature
* Multiple key operations can happen in a transaction
* Many advanced operations can be implemented as Layers on top of that
    storage abstraction. There is even a SQL layer for that.
* FDB scales nicely as you add new nodes to the cluster
* Cluster of up to 6 nodes can be used for free in production
* We (or Tomas, to be more precise :]) managed to get 75k write
    transactions out of a small cluster we setup at the digital Ocean
* Setting up a cluster is a no-brainer even for a Linux noob like me
* FDB handles load distribution automatically, it moves data as
    necessary, too
* FDB has client libraries for python, golang, erlang, Node.js and
    even .NET
* Their team is **extremely helpful and humble**
* You can configure level of replication (e.g.: single, double,
    triple) before write is ACKed
* FDB can be configured to store views in memory or on disk,
    transaction store is always durable

We are planning to use FDB as our event store and for persisting view
models (which will be replicated across the cluster). I'm actually the
one having fun with that implementation. Event Storage itself is a
simple abstraction, however making implementation work properly with
FDB key-value storage is something that requires better insight into
inner workings of FDB. Plus, I get to do that in a go language.

My next week will focus on getting our full planned stack to play
together (in an extremely jacky way), so that we could start
developing components for the HPC2.

PS: my current development environment looks like this (Ubuntu LTS +
"awesome" tiling manager + sublime + GoSublime):
