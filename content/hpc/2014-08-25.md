The highlight of the last week was **switch from pure Go driver for
PostgreSQL to a wrapper around native library**
`jgallagher/go-libpq`. Pure Go driver seemed like a nice thing in the
beginning (no need to bother with native dependencies or header
files), however it turned out to bee too immature. Confusing error
reporting for connection issues was one of the biggest problems for
us.

Thanks to `database/sql` abstraction in golang, I was able to switch
to native driver in one day. Cleanups mostly involved our handling of
`uuid` type. Wrapper around **native PostgreSQL client library offers
similar performance and wonderful error reporting**.

There were a few issues with our code while trying to run Finland,
they were mostly solved by replacing client-side transactional upsert
statements with PostgreSQL upsert statements using Common Table
Expressions. One rare race condition in `chat` module was fixed with a
tiny smoke tester and a fine-grained row lock.

We were able to run entire Finland dataset (except visits) in `2m53s`,
which is comparable to pure go driver. Sweden takes more time, but it
actually runs, without any big issues.

> As long as our system can handle burst of events coming from the
entire dataset, running the usual production load should never be a
problem.

Aside from the peformance, I spent time implementing `albums` module
(permissions on private photo album), adding proper implementation of
the `profile` (public view of approved user information with any
permissions applied). Then, I also went across the codebase cleaning
up modules and adding missing use cases. Functionality of these
modules is completely covered now: `news`, `alerts`, `chat`, `block`,
`likes`, `poll`, `flirt`, `profile`, `diary`, `albums`, `favorite`.

`draft`, `auth`, `review` lack use cases, so that is one thing we will
try to fix this week.

These use cases become even more important to use, since we check
multiple things while verifying them:

- verify that all expectations are met;
- ensure that there are no connection leaks in code being tested;
- check that all events present in `given` are listed in module
  declaration (it is used to route only the needed events to module
  queues in RabbitMQ)

I also removed all legacy HTML stuff from our back-end code. This
separation improved it a lot. Hopefully, today we'll decide on our
front-end strategy and start implementing this last missing bit. Use
cases help to close feedback loop, but there is nothing like a
tangible product.

_Pieter_ and _Tomas_ were busy this week dealing with performance
optimizations of the code and performing these time consuming runs on
the production data. I think, they have quite a lot to share about the
inner workings of RabbitMQ and PostgreSQL on Glesys datacenter (VMWare
virtualization).
