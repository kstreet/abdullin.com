It is a pleasure to work with such a codebase. Someone else will have
to continue that, though. This **project is complete**: we've got the
foundation up and running.

It was a great experience to work and learn in a distirbuted HPC team:

* _Tomas_ has a unique ability to explore new technologies, learn fast
and adapt. His decisions are always based on vast experience and
large number of facts, while ultimately driving towards simplicity.

* _Pieter_ is an awesome team-mate to work with. He learns and accepts
changes fast. It was a pleasure to discover and refine project
domain towards a deeper insight and simplicity with him.

The journey was fun and exciting. We should do it again sometime. I'm
definitely interested to get my hands dirty with a similar project.
