Last two weeks went fast.

I mostly focused on the backend, rewriting some of our older modules
(`register`, `draft`, `review` and `auth`) to match JSON API
requirements and covering them with use-cases. Missing edge cases were
addressed as well.

There were also a few technical features, affecting the entire codebase.

First of all, I added **role-based security** to the system, extending
authorization to support various levels of super-users, like admins
and reviewers. This required a slight adjustment of use case
infrastructure.

Second, Tomas asked to get rid of all stored procedures in the
code. So I simply reconfigured use case verifier to **throw errors on
any module that declares stored procedures**. A few more hours to clean
up the code, and we are guaranteed not to have this problem any more.

Third, I introduced a quick way to **stress test a single module in
isolation** by running a special `stress` utility. This is faster than
generating Finland/Sweden events and passing them through the
system. `Stress` utility works by taking all use cases of a module and
using them to generate events over and over again. It works
automatically and provides really fast feedback.

Fourth, I went through the entire codebase, **replacing backend-side
upsert statements with PSQL upsert queries**, while also **switching
queries to use prepared statements**. This helped to resolve a lot of
concurrency issues (detected by `stress` tool) and speed up the
execution by 40% on local machine and by 5-7% at the glesys
environment.



Fifth, I made **all event handlers idempotent**. This is needed to
handle message duplication in cases of network partitions (something
that might happen with RabbitMQ). The solution was to simply extend
our use case verifier. After performing a normal run, it goes through
all the use cases, duplicating one event at a time and making sure
that all expectations still match. Then I simply went through the
solution, fixing all tests that appeared to be broken. Afterwards this
logic was added to the build process, to ensure that new code will
stay idempotent.

_Pieter_ spent most of his time working on the **performance and
stability of the codebase**. He used our Finland and Sweden datasets
as a tool to make the system more robust. This also involved
**improving our RabbitMQ bus to make it reconnect on network
failures** (golang client doesn't do that out of the box).

_Tomas_ was busy with **maintenance of HPC1**, tweaking it and
**moving the entire system to new servers on Glesys**. This included
migration of all 3 countries, SQL DBs, media files and app
servers. Lot's of work to do.


## User Interface

Tomas has a vision of a _Single-Page Application_ (SPA), where we
would have rich experience on the clients with the ability to support
older browsers. This SPA could even be shipped as a native app to
desktops and mobile phones (via something like PhoneGap), offering
really nice user experience.

At the end of the last week I finally started working in this
direction. Our primary choice of technology is `rendr` from AirBNB. It
is a relatively small library that allows to run the same JS code on
the server and the client, rendering HTML at either one, depending on
the state.

Working with `rendr` actually involves touching multiple technologies:
`node.js`, `expresso stack`, `backbone.js`, `handlebars.js`. So I
started by picking these technologies one at a time and learning more
about them. That's what I plan to focus on during the next week.
