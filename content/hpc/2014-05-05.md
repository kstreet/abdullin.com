Last week, as planned, was quite short but very interesting.

Development of the reactive prototype at some moment hit a complexity
point where a dead-simple hacky approach could no longer
work. Although go language (with its simple flavor of behavior
composition) allowed to go pretty far on that route, in order to move
forward, I had to bite the bullet and refactor things from a _big ball
of mud_ to a collection of components.

That’s when I realized that I already enjoy coding in golang as much
as I enjoyed working with C# in Visual Studio with ReSharper after 8
years of practice in it.

After that refactoring I was able to move forward with the domain
exploration (in case of HappyPancake domain includes both the social
networking and technical peculiarities of developing reactive
application at a social scale).

One of the interesting aspects of the development was the interplay between:

* **reactive nature** of this prototype (new notifications are
    rendered on the server and pushed to the client through http
    polling feed);
* **different ways of handling the same event** from different
    contexts and screens (e.g.: a chat message would be appended to
    the conversation in a chat screen but it will show up as a
    notification box in another screen);
* **different ways of persisting and delivering information to the
    users** (e.g.: chat history is loaded via range read from
    FoundationDB, while all updates to this history are pushed to the
    client through the notification feed);
* focus on **reducing CPU and latency** for the mobile devices
    (e.g. last 75 messages in a chat come pre-rendered in the page
    HTML on the first page request, while new messages are pushed
    incrementally by appending server-generated HTML to the DOM);
* our desire to have **graceful degradation of the user experience**
    for some of the older mobile platforms (users could still get some
    chat experience even if javascript does not work at all).

At this point, I think, we have a pretty good understanding of the
domain around messaging and notification feeds. We have:

* a bunch of implementations and use cases captured in the tangible
    and working code;
* strategy for scaling the performance in a variety of scenarios (with
    known price to pay for that in terms of complexity or
    consistency);
* some understanding of how we would deal with devops later on.

Meanwhile, _Pieter_ was working on the other half of HappyPancake
- understanding and developing interactions around document
based flows in the social network - registration, logins,
profile editing and reviewing. All with PJAX and basic http handlers
(we discarded Revel, since it does too much CPU-intensive magic).

_Tomas_, as usually, focused on backing up our development. He took
care of the v1 maintenance, campaigns and also invested in capturing
use cases for us to move forward.

It was extremely interesting to sync up with Tomas and Pieter
occasionally, sharing concerns and discoveries along the road. It felt
like getting an instantaneous deeper insight into the problem we are
trying to tackle here.

Another really awesome part of the last week was about gradual
transition from purely technical use cases (consistency, availability
and latency issues) to practical use cases that matter to our users
(flirts, messages, visits etc). Although technology is an important
part of HappyPancake, users are the domain that we ultimately trying
to understand and master.

The upcoming week will be a bit longer than the previous for me, but
still only 4 days (May 9th is another holiday).

We plan to start my prototype into Pieter’s prototype, while moving
forward and adding more use cases. I hope to also move forward with
newsfeeds. They require a balance between consistency and availability
that is different from notifications and chat messages (more like the
Instagram news feeds).
