I spent the last week **learning Javascript, Node.js and some of the
ecosystem**. _JavaScript : The Good Parts_ and _Node.js: Up and
Running_ were a good introduction into the field.

It is **surprising how diverse and rich node.js ecosystem is**. I
think, this could be attributed to the language itself. JavaScript is
everywhere, and it is extremely flexible. This creates a lot of
diversity for both good and evil.

Besides, it is really easy for anybody to publish node.js
packages. There are thousands of them, including some real gems.

I'm gradually **falling in love with node.js for front-end development
purposes**. There just is too much goodness already implemented for
you (if compared to .NET or golang environments, for
example). **Golang is still quite good for backends**, though.

My impression of node.js is clearly **biased**, since I was focusing only
on the technologies required for our front-end. Here the list
of things I've been learning about:

- [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) - **lightweight model-view
library** ([great introduction](http://tech.pro/tutorial/1367/part-1-backbonejs-deconstructed)).
- [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/) - nice **templating library**.
- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) - JavaScript **task runner**.
- [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) - **functional programming
helpers**.
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/) - popular **web application
framework**.  for node.js (used in rendr) with a lot of middleware
available.
- [hapi](http://hapijs.com/) - another **server framework for
Node.js** (powering Lazo.js).
- [Require.js](http://requirejs.org/) - an **implementation of
Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)**, used by Lazo.js to load
modules on client and server.
- [Rx.js](https://rxjs.codeplex.com/) - **reactive extensions for
JavaScript**, coming from the Microsoft world.
- [Rendrjs](https://github.com/rendrjs/rendr) - framework to **render
  Backbone.js apps on the client and the server**, using Node.js.
- [Lazojs](https://github.com/walmartlabs/lazojs) - **client-server
web framework** for building decomposed single-page applications with
optimized first page load and SEO compliance.

**Rendr project turned out to be lacking** for our needs. However,
_Tomas_ discovered **more polished alternative to it: LazoJS** from
_Walmart Labs_.

By the end of the week **we switched focus to LazoJS** and started
evaluating it. Documentation is awesome in this project.

I'll start this week by implementing an infinite scrolling for our
news feed in lazo.js (with all the SPA benefits), then will continue
adding other front-end features.

_Tomas_ was **extremely busy with the migration work during the
week**. Moving the most popular dating web site in a country has a lot
of challenges. This process is done for HPC1 for now. This week Tomas
plans to **enrich HPC1 with additional data capture capabilities**. This
way we'll be able to serve better news for our members in HPC2.

_Pieter_ was away on his well-deserved vacation, driving a new bike
all around the Europe. He is with us this week, getting back to
**making our HPC middleware battle-ready**. Welcome back, buddy!
