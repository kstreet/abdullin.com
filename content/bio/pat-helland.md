Pat Helland is a really smart guy. He was Platform Architect at Microsoft (big-picture strategy), then spent a couple of years at Amazon.com helping the company with its service-oriented-architecture (SOA) strategy. In March 2007 Pat rejoined Microsoft to become a part of the companyâ€™s Developer Division.

He recently has worked on the projects like:

  * Bing Infrastructure.
  * Cosmos
  * Autopilot.


> Cosmos is a petabyte store (working towards being an exabyte store)
> which runs over tens of thousands of inexpensive computers.

Pat authored a set of extremely interesting and thoughtful papers:

* <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~cs223/papers/cidr07p15.pdf" target="_blank" class="offsite-link-inline">Life Beyond Distributed Transactions: An Apostate's Opinion</a>

These papers help to shape understanding and body of knowledge in building massively scalable systems. It's strong recommendation to read these if you are studying <a href="http://abdullin.com/cqrs/">CQRS</a> and <a href="http://abdullin.com/xlim/">xLim</a> or simply building solution for the <a href="http://abdullin.com/wiki/cloud-computing.html">cloud computing</a> environment.
