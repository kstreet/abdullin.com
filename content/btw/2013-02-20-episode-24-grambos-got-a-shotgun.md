title: E24 - Grambo's Got A Shotgun
---
<p>Kerry and Rinat dive into the GTDÂ® code and discuss ways to choose words in the ubiquitous language.  The new interactive shell allows them to use and shape the domain model as it evolves.  In addition, an Event store is introduced to persist messages to disk, and they discuss ways to replay and view these state changes in the console.</p>


<p><strong>Homework:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go into the project, run the Shell, and try adding more Commands/Events and Console commands to make it work.</li>
</ul>
