title: E36 - Break It Down Again
---
<p>In this episode Kerry and Rinat discuss some of the benefits of decomposing your software into even smaller components.  Some may refer to this technique as "micro services" or "system-of-systems".  They end their conversation with a look at how this approach was applied to the Lokad codebase to result in a more evolvable design.</p>
