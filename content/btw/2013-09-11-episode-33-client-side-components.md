---
<p>Kerry and Rinat return from their summer break to discuss their initial explorations into client-side development.  This episode, and the two episodes after it, cover a two month period in which Rinat and Kerry went off to write some new client code for their Getting Things Done(tm) sample project.  They start this three-part spike with a simple WinForms client, and end it with the beginnings of their cross-platform mobile application. </p>
