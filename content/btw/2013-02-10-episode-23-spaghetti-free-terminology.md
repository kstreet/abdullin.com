---
<p>Kerry and Rinat revisit and correct some DDD terminology they used based on new learning and listener feedback.  After they readdress Domain, Domain Model, Subdomains, Bounded Contexts, Published Language, Shared Kernel, and Anti-Corruption Layer, they try to relate these terms to real examples and code.</p>
