title: E28 - Learning Lokad CQRS
---
<p>Kerry and Rinat dig into the Lokad CQRS project that laid the code foundation for their current projects. This open source sample provides a working slice of a production system's registration and user management subdomains that were implemented with Aggregates and Event Sourcing. While they get into the details of its multi-Aggregate implementation, they cover the communication and workflow between these aggregates, how data storage and querying is achieved, and even get into some authentication and authorization options.</p>
