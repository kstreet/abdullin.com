title: "E08 - Frameworks Over Forms Is A Design Obsession"
---
<p>Rinat covers some of his previous obsessions with certain tools and technologies [like composite UIs, Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs), and Inversion of Control (IoC) Containers] and reminds us that even the approach we have been learning is also, <strong>JUST A TOOL</strong>.  The focus of your design should be on the essence of the domain that you are capturing and the problems you are trying to solve, not on specific tools or technologies.</p>



<p><strong>Homework:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have a look at the source code inside of the Open Source <a href="http://geteventstore.com/">Event Store</a> project</li>
<li>Notice the use of various programming languages (C#, C++, JavaScript) as well as how the code reads like a story given the context of the event message persistence domain that it was designed for.</li>
</ul>
