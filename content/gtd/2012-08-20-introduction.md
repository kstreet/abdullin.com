In a summer of 2012 Kerry Street offered to start a small podcast
about learning software development. It wasn't supposed to be fancy or
professionally edited, focusing instead on discovery, coding and
mistakes that we were going to make.

> Years later, we are still pushing, thanks to Kerry and our awesome
> community.

Later, [BeingTheWorst Podcast](http://beingtheworst.com) turned out to
be one of the longest and most successful projects I ever participated
in. For that I will be gratefull to Kerry forever.

In that podcast we started exploring things like Domain-Driven Design,
Event Sourcing and CQRS.


Somewhere along the way we decided to take on the domain of
<em>Getting Things Done</em>, writing yet another task manager.

> Our GTD implementation was inspired by OmniFocus - an awesome task
> manager for OSX and iOS.

This is the story of that journey.

If you have some spare time, you could start listening to episodes
from [the beginning](http://beingtheworst.com/episodes-en). Otherwise,
feel free to [fast forward to year 2015](/gtd/) (we started our latest
iteration then).
