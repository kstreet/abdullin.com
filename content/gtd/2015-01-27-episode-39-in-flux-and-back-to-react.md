Kerry and Rinat return. The guys catch-up on some of the development
that Rinat’s been doing while they were away and set their recording
timer to 30 minutes. They discuss that their sample GTD domain, from
past episodes, is being implemented with Facebook Flux and React.JS as
they set the stage for future episodes.
