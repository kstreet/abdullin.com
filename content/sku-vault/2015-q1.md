## Introduction

First quarter of 2015 is behind. We managed to achieve some impressive
results at SkuVault. This will allow us to offer new features and a
better product to customers in the second quarter of 2015.


> [Catalyst 2015](http://www.channeladvisor.com/catalyst2015/) -
> ChannelAdvisor’s annual industry conference, one of the most
> important events for e-commerce.

Last week Catalyst 2015 took place, where SkuVault was a bronze
sponsor and had an exhibition booth.

This conference was a big milestone for us: we had an opportunity to
demo **a completely new feature there** - _Interactive WavePicking_.

>Wave picking in warehouse management systems is a process of grouping
>incoming orders into small batches (picklists), which are assigned to
>workers for assembly. This way a worker can assemble multiple orders
>in parallel, increasing the overall throughput.

> [Interactive WavePicking](http://skuvault.com/features/interactive-wavepicking.php)
> in SkuVault provides ability to create these picklists from pending
> sales, using various criteria. When this picklist is assigned to a
> worker, the worker will get guidance from SkuVault, telling where to
> go, which item to pick and which compartment in the cart to put it
> into. This guidance is location-aware, thus it minimizes walking
> around the warehouse and increases the overall throughput of the
> assembly process.

It was hard to implement this feature in SkuVault v1 design (based on
CQRS/ES architecture), so a different approach to design and
development was required. We aimed at two goals simultaneously:

* come up with a new software design, tailored for SkuVault project to
  use in further development and constructed to serve customers better
  in the upcoming years;

* implement a new feature using that design.

**Implementation of the feature was an indicator of success or failure
of the new design**. If development of the feature works out, then the
new design is good enough to move forward with. If it doesn’t, then we
fail early and save the effort of a major rewrite and a cost of a big
failure.

I think, we did well. **SkuVault team demonstrated WavePicking at
Catalyst 2015**, and soon this feature will be available to all
customers. Benefits of the new design will come forth in the next
quarters of 2015.

Major thanks go to:

* _Slav Ivanyuk_ - for managing the process and doing all
  super-helpful code reviews
* _Chris Witt_ - for picking up ReactJS/Flux and doing all the work in
  UIv2
* _Jason Henson_ - for helping with the demo setup, testing and
  deployment

Feature design was driven by SkuVault experts, who had to do a very
complex job of identifying the feature essence and figuring out which
parts would need to make it into MVP: _Andy Eastes_, _Slav Ivanyuk_
and _Danny Shaw_.

In order to prepare path for Interactive WavePicking we had to:

* Design and implement a new infrastructure for the next UI version
  and backend with APIs.
* Provide a way to integrate v2 with v1 in various environments:
  production, where we have more than 20GBs of events coming at high
  throughput, QA with auto-deployable backend and demo with in-memory
  backend hosted inside IIS process.
* Figure out an approach for gradual migration of all existing
  features from v1 to v2.
* Figure out a way to improve testability, scalability in new design,
  while making it easier to develop and learn.

So here is what we achieved so far.

## New Infrastructure

> Caveat: this retrospective covers only a fraction of SkuVault's life
> that I was involved in.

If we forget about integration with v1 code, the new infrastructure is
quite simple.

**Backend** is a collection of .NET modules with an API (JSON over
HTTP, provided by NancyFx). Each module can subscribe to events and
publish events (async, batched). Modules behaviour can be captured in
use cases, which are then applied to verify the correctness of the
implementation.

> C#.

**Middleware** to pass events between modules and also from v1 to v2
is MessageVault
([available on github](https://github.com/agileharbor/messageVault)). It
is a simple Kafka-inspired event bus, which uses Windows Azure to
maintain a highly-available transaction log. Reads are served by
Windows Azure storage (via a .NET client library), while writes are
handled by a cluster of worker roles (master election is done via
Azure blob locks).

![SkuVault Middleware](/images/2015-04-04-sku-vault-message-vault.jpg)

**Front-end** in v2 is an absolute pleasure to work with. Previous version
is a single project based on ASP.NET MVC with AngularJS and Lokad.CQRS
client libraries. New version is a collection of single-page web
applications (one web app per major feature), which are statically
compiled into JS and CSS bundles. These apps are stateless (web server
simply serves the content) and get all data directly from backend API.

> server can serve them, making development and deployment process very
> flexible. Just at SkuVault, we can serve UIv2 via: webpack (dev
> environment), Azure Web Sites (QA and PROD environments), IIS (demo
> environment).

Internally we chose to use ReactJS with Fluxible, since that was the
stack we had arrived at during HappyPancake. This software design is
backed up by the work done at Facebook and Instagram (it is always
good to stand on the shoulders of giants).

_Chris Witt_ jumped right into the development process and tackled the
UI side of feature development since then. He did a very good job.

For example, the UI below allows warehouse managers to create
picklists from pending sales. They can apply a dozen of filters to
these sales, pick individual sales or batches, reorder sales in the
picklist.

![New WavePicking Session](/images/2015-04-06-sku-vault-new-session.png)

With ReactJS, we decomposed a relatively complex UI into
domain-specific reusable components; FLUX architecture pattern
provided a consistent way to capture event-driven UI and client-server
interactions in the code. It was easy for multiple developers to work
in the resulting codebase, both to continue each other’s work and to
develop UI elements in parallel.

## Software Design

**Feature decoupling** is the most important aspect in our new
design. Even though wave picking is quite complex to implement (that’s
why it is rarely handled properly in warehouse management), in
SkuVault this complexity is isolated from the rest of the system.

WavePicking backend API is a separate event-driven module, which can
be tested, deployed and scaled independently from the rest of the
backend (it can also run in-process with all the rest, for the demo,
development and on-premises deployments).

Similarly, Wave-picking UI is a separate web application composed from
reusable ReactJS components, Flux actions and stores. This application
benefits from shared elements (e.g. styles, login/logoff, UI
components, build process), but it can be developed and deployed
separately.


This gives us the benefit of **controlled system evolution**: we can
take existing features and transition them to our new design one by
one, minimising the risks and avoiding the total rewrite. In parallel,
we can add completely new features.


Splitting the system into modules and UI features with well-defined
boundaries also **simplifies team management and resource
allocation**. It is easier to manage development of several isolated
features than to coordinate development within a single tightly
coupled product. It is also simpler to scale the development process,
too.

Explicit **separation between the UI and backend with API** was an
important design decision with a long-lasting impact on existing
product. First, it allows us to divide (and conquer) development into
two distinct contexts with very different specifics and challenges:

* backend and API development focuses on the core domain, scalability
  and making it very easy for UI folks to build various front-end
  features. That is pure .NET with low-level optimisations for
  performance and scalability.
* UI is going to be THE primary consumer of API, but not the only one:
  mobile clients and partners will be using it as well. It cares more
  about the User Experience, feedback, rapid development iterations
  and pure HTML/JS/CSS development (for the Web).

Another interesting side-effect of the design is that we get **cheap UI
deployments and foundation for A/B testing**. One can simply copy
feature UI files to a new directory on a web server, getting a
different version deployment. If you point different users to
different versions of a feature, you get the ability to do gradual
roll-outs, per-user customizations and the grounds for A/B testing.

On the backend side, development process is enhanced by event-driven
use-cases introduced to specify and verify API behavior
scenarios. These use-cases improve upon existing specifications at
SkuVault, making them less fragile and focused more on the public
contract rather than internal implementation.

![SkuVault Use-cases in C#](/images/2015-04-06-sku-vault-use-cases-code.png)

Unlike traditional unit tests, API verification with use-cases can
pinpoint the problem in case of failure. As a result, this process
saves development time and lends itself to “Getting Things Done”
mentality.

![SkuVault use-case verification](/images/2015-04-06-sku-vault-use-case-verification.png)

Use-cases additionally grant us other benefits:

* API documentation can be generated automatically. It will always
  stay up-to-date and its quality will be better than what libraries
  like ServiceStack and NancyFx can auto-generate provide
  out-of-the-box.
* Use-cases align very well with the development process, making it
  easier to manage. Especially well it works with Domain-Driven
  Design, which SkuVault already employs.
* Sensible stress-tests can be auto-generated out of the
  use-cases. They allow running the system through all the scenarios
  from the specifications, but repeated 1000 times or more. This
  capability does not replace custom stress-testing scripts, but it
  comes for free. Build server can run stress tests on each commit,
  watching for performance regressions and correlating them with
  changes in the code.

## Development Process

I think, we managed to **reduce development friction** in v2. UI
features in v2 are incrementally recompiled on-the-fly whenever a file
changes (thanks to the webpack). We also leverage webpack dev server
to handle hot reload (when compilation happens in memory and changes
are pushed to the browser). This speeds up web development
dramatically.

UIv2 features no longer require ASP.NET MVC, so it is not bound to
Visual Studio (or to Microsoft Windows itself). Developers are free to
choose an environment that fits their needs.

Tools like WebPack, ESLint, ES transpilers work from the command line
and are supported by all modern IDEs.

![Editing UIv2 in SkuVault in Emacs](/images/2015-04-06-sku-vault-react-emacs.png)

We also observed that **ReactJS simplifies UI development**,
especially for user interfaces with complex interactions, and when
compared to the MV* designs (MVC, MVVM, MVP). That increases
productivity and lowers development risks.

> ASP.NET MVC + AngularJS + jQuery to ReactJS, however the effort pays
> for itself soon.


To make UI development more productive, we use LESS preprocessor for
styles (also managed by the webpack), lodash for functional helpers in
JS and superagent for AJAX calls.

User interactions are all captured in vanilla JavaScript at the moment
(later we might enable some ES6 features, which can be transpiled down
to ES5 by webpack).

**JavaScript can be tricky**, to make development more reliable we
run a linter (ESLint) with a rather strict set of rules. It forces all
code to be written consistently, avoiding code smells and bad
practices. These rules are enforced by the build server.

**Real-time statistics and logs** are still evolving at
SkuVault. Although there are a few glitches (e.g. Hekad integration is
less than perfect on Windows), we are consistently improving the
experience. At the moment we have more than 80GB of searchable logs
handled by ElasticSearch and visualized by Kibana. Carbon and Graphite
take care of capturing and reporting dozens of stats from various
cloud services running on Azure (starting from RAM/CPU consumption and
down to a specific web request latency).

![MessageVault dashboard](/images/2015-04-06-sku-vault-mv-dashboard.png)

Statistics and logs aren’t a mission-critical piece of infrastructure,
however they are extremely helpful in understanding software behaviour
under production loads. SkuVault needs to scale a lot to serve new
customers better, and this toolkit provides real-time insight for that
(aside from helping us to debug any potential issues).

Instrumenting the existing code to write to the distributed log or to
report a new stat metric is easy. API v2 comes with these capabilities
from the start, since we are planning to go for aggressive scalability
targets with it.

**Learning process and complexity** had to be factored in the new design
as well. The simpler it is for developers to understand the design and
become productive in it, the simpler it will be for the company to
find new talent and to grow.

Here is the list of technologies which v2 aims to discard (for good):

* ASP.NET MVC and all web development in .NET
* Angular.JS with jQuery
* ServiceStack API
* Lokad.CQRS

Instead we introduce:

* ReactJS/Flux
* NancyFx

So far knowledge transfer for UIv2 development had been rather smooth
within the company (thanks to the talented developers of SkuVault).

## Long-term Impact

It is always nice to consider possible **long-term benefits** that could
come either cheap or for free. With the new design we potentially get:

* Well-used and tested API, which could support various clients.
* Ability to reuse the experience and product knowledge of our web
  developers to build native clients for the modern mobile platforms:
  iOS and Android (thanks to React Native).
* Path for scaling out the system (API is scaled by modules and then
  partitioned by tenants; UI is stateless and can scale infinitely).
* Support for on-premises deployments of SkuVault, along with
  geo-affinity around the world.
* Ability to deploy system to different clouds to provide higher
availability guarantees to our customers.

## What's Next?

For SkuVault, **scaling and stability is the primary focus for Q2
2015**. We are going to take existing features one by one and migrate
them to the new design, while improving test coverage and performance.

New event-driven design gains solid APIs in UI (ReactJS) and on the
backend (event-driven design), which reduces coupling and fragility,
leading to a simpler and smaller codebase.

In order to achieve these goals, continuous integration and build
process will also have to be enhanced. We are interested in fast
builds and development feedback.

Fast builds in v2 are already a part of the design: UIv2 doesn't have
.NET in the pipeline at all (plus webpack provides continuous builds),
while backend gets faster builds due to the smaller solution
footprint.

Build process itself could get feedback from:

* Static analysis: ESLint and Flow in JavaScript.
* Unit-Tests: testing a single component.
* Integration tests: use-case verification, derived sanity checks and
  tests for interactions between the components.
* Automatic UI/UX verification via scripted user interactions
  (e.g. WebDriver)
* Performance tests: scenarios derived from use-cases and custom ones.
* Codebase size and complexity tracking.

Ideally, developers would get this feedback within 5-10 minutes after
a commit - while they can fix issues most efficiently.

As more features migrate from v1 to v2, we will pull more developers
into the new environment. The knowledge transfer facilitation has
already started, it will have to be managed more explicitly in Q2.

All in all, 2015 Q2 is going to be a very interesting time at SkuVault :)


_Many thanks to Slav, Andy and Ksenia for reviews._
