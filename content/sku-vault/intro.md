At the end of 2014 [AgileHarbor](http://agileharbor.com) invited me to
assist in the development of [SkuVault](http://www.skuvault.com): _a
rapidly growing web-based warehouse management system for eCommerce_.

I'll be assisting [Slav Ivanyuk](http://agileharbor.com/about/index.php)
and his developers on a part-time basis. The role would be one of
_serving software engineer_:

* **suggesting solutions** for the problems;
* **sharing mistakes** and good decisions from the other projects;
* **offering software design ideas** to simplify and scale existing
  system.

This is the story of this journey.
